# Breakout

An updated and modernized version of an old project I did to learn Phaser. There were several goals with this project:

## Generative AI Pipeline

In the past gathering art assets, dealing with licensing and costs and all the headache involved became such a massive time sink that I never had time to write any actual code. Although I still have to do some minor editing here and there, AI has finally reaced a point where I can quickly gather all the art, sound, and music I need. And I can include fully buildable source code since I own the rights to the assets.

## Tech Stack Experimenting

Now that I can focus on coding more, I can work more on ideas I've been wanting to experiment with. I've had the idea of using a game library in conjuntion with a UI library. In this case using Phaser with SolidJS. It works, but there are a lot of little quirks that need worked out.

## Continued Learning

And, of course, it's always good to keep pushing myself. Have to keep those coding muscles in shape, right?
